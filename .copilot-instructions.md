# GitHub Copilot Project Instructions

These are the rules and best practices Copilot should follow for this repository.  
Copilot should always consider these instructions when suggesting code.

---

## General Rules
1. ✅ Only generate files that are explicitly required.  
   - Do NOT create extra or unused files.  
   - Do NOT suggest placeholder/example files unless requested.

2. ✅ Always align with the **prompt or current context**.  
   - Stay specific to the problem being solved.  
   - Do NOT drift into unrelated suggestions.

3. ✅ Follow existing **project structure, naming conventions, and file organization**.  
   - Use consistent naming (camelCase, PascalCase, or snake_case depending on context).  
   - Keep imports and folder paths valid.

4. ✅ Write **minimal, clean, and working code**.  
   - No unnecessary boilerplate.  
   - No dead code or unused variables. 
   - Naver made changes in .copilot-instructions.md file.
   - Do not add comments like "Add your logic here" unless explicitly required.

5. ✅ Ensure code is **readable and well-structured**.  
   - Prefer clarity over cleverness.  
   - Add meaningful comments only where helpful.

## Language & Framework Rules
- Always use the **frameworks/libraries already in use in this repo**.  
- Do not suggest switching frameworks unless specifically asked.  
- Follow project conventions (React + Tailwind, Next.js, Python, etc.).  

---

## Error Prevention
- Avoid creating duplicate functions/components.  
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.  
- Ensure imports and exports are correct and consistent.  
- Handle edge cases when possible instead of writing only the "happy path."

## Best Practices (Added by Assistant)
1. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – if code looks repetitive, suggest refactoring.  
2. **Performance Awareness** – prefer efficient solutions (avoid O(n²) loops where O(n) is possible).  
3. **Security** – avoid hardcoding secrets, keys, or sensitive data.  
4. **Scalability** – keep components modular and reusable where appropriate.  
5. **Testing Mindset** – write code that’s testable and avoid tightly coupling logic with UI.  

---

## Output Style
- Suggest complete, working code snippets (not partial unless asked).  
- No unused placeholder code.  
- Keep suggestions concise and relevant to the current task.

⚡ Always re-check suggestions before completion to ensure they follow these rules.
